Smart Campus Recovery System

Problem:
Students often lose personal items on campus and there is no centralized system to recover them.

Solution:
An AI-powered platform where students can report lost and found items using descriptions and photos.

How It Works:
Users log in with college ID, report items, AI matches details, and admin verifies before return.

Impact:
Saves time, reduces stress, and improves campus security.
